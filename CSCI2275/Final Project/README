THIS IS THE README FOR MY FINAL PROJECT FOR CSCI2275

Purpose: Create an efficient parking lot system for personal venture.

Data Structures:
 - Red-Black Tree
 - Priority Queue

Structures:
 - cns                             // Structure containing car information and parking spot information.
   - spot                          // Structure containing information about ach spot the car is in.
     - int spotNumber              // Contains the number of the parking ParkingSpot their in (randomly generated).
     - bool reserved               // Tells whether the spot is reserved or not (People w/ reserved spots will need a pass in their window and will have a yellow light instead of read or green).
     - bool taken                  // Tells whether the spot is taken using sensors over each parking spot (Green light indicates open and red light indicates taken).
   - car                           // Structure containing information about the car.
     - int timeIn                  // Holds the realtime the car entered the parking lot (may need to be of type chrono using chrono.h).
     - int timeOut                 // Set only when the car leaves and used to calculate price to charge.
   
   
   - string color                  // Used for rebalancing the tree.
   - cns* left                     // Stores left child in tree.
   - cns* right                    // Stores right child in tree.
   - cns* parent                   // Stores parent in tree.

Members: 
 - void carEnters(cns e)           // Add to the RB tree.
 - cns* carLeaves(cns l)                // Remove from the RB tree.
 - void recolor(cns* root)         // Balance the RB tree.
 - void rightRotate(cns* rootST)   // Called by recolor to rebalance the tree at a certain subtree root.
 - void leftRotate(cns* rootST)    // Called by recolor to rebalance the tree at a certain subtree root.
 - cns* search()                   // Searches for specific spot in the tree using timeIn.
 - void assignSpot()               // Randomly assign a spot to the car that enters (checks takenand reseved statuses).
 - bool reserveSpot()
