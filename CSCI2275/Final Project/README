PARKING GARAGE SIMULATION

Semester: Fall 2020

PROJECT SUMMARY:
This project simulates software used to track cars coming in and out of a parking garage. 
All of the cars are stored in a red-black tree for the most efficient storage, and calculations 
of price charged to a car when it leaves are done automatically based on a realtime clock. 
I decided to do this project because I will be working on a start up idea with my peers having
to do with parking garages (but that is all I can say about it). This code will be used as a 
jumping off point for that project and built upon in the future.
