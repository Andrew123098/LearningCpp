PARKING GARAGE SIMULATION

Semester: Fall 2020

PROJECT SUMMARY:
This project simulates software used to track cars coming in and out of a parking garage. 
All of the cars are stored in a red-black tree for the most efficient storage, and calculations 
of price charged to a car when it leaves are done automatically based on a realtime clock. 
I decided to do this project because I will be working on a start up idea with my peers having
to do with parking garages (but that is all I can say about it). This code will be used as a 
jumping off point for that project and built upon in the future. 

HOW TO RUN:
Step 1: Fork repository.
Step 2: Download repository to local computer.
Step 3: Open local repository in VS Code or IDE of your choice.
Step 4: Open terminal at the local repository. (Make sure repository has parkingLot.cpp, CarAndSpot.cpp and CarAndSpot.h)
Step 5: Run the following command in your terminal to compile the program. - (Assuming mingw or gcc compiler)
  g++ -std=c++11 parkingLot.cpp CarAndSpot.cpp -o parkingLot
Step 6: Run the following command in your terminal to run the program.
  ./parkingLot
