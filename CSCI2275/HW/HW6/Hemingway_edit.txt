old he was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the gulf stream and he had gone eightyfour
days now without taking a fish in the first forty days a boy had been with him but after forty days
without a fish the boys parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally salao
which is the worst form of unlucky and the boy had gone at their orders in another boat which
caught three good fish the first week it made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with
his skiff empty and he always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and
harpoon and the sail that was furled around the mast the sail was patched with flour sacks and
furled it looked like the flag of permanent defeat
 the old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck the brown
blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were
on his cheeks the blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deepcreased
scars from handling heavy fish on the cords but none of these scars were fresh they were as old as
erosions in a fishless desert
 everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the sea and were
cheerful and undefeated
 santiago the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the skiff was hauled up i
could go with you again weve made some money
 the old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him
 no the old man said youre with a lucky boat stay with them
 but remember how you went eightyseven days without fish and then we caught big ones
every day for three weeks
 i remember the old man said i know you did not leave me because you doubted

 it was papa made me leave i am a boy and i must obey him
 i know the old man said it is quite normal
 he hasnt much faith
 no the old man said but we have havent we
 yes the boy said can i offer you a beer on the terrace and then well take the stuff home
 why not the old man said between fishermen
 they sat on the terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old man and he was not
angry others of the older fishermen looked at him and were sad but they did not show it and they
spoke politely about the current and the depths they had drifted their lines at and the steady good
weather and of what they had seen the successful fishermen of that day were already in and had
butchered their marlin out and carried them laid full length across two planks with two men
staggering at the end of each plank to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry
them to the market in havana those who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on
the other side of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle their livers removed their
fins cut off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for salting
 when the wind was in the east a smell came across the harbour from the shark factory but
today there was only the faint edge of the odour because the wind had backed into the north
and then dropped off and it was pleasant and sunny on the terrace
 santiago the boy said
 yes the old man said he was holding his glass and thinking of many years ago
 can i go out to get sardines for you for tomorrow
 no go and play baseball i can still row and rogelio will throw the net
 i would like to go if i cannot fish with you i would like to serve in some way
 you bought me a beer the old man said you are already a man
 how old was i when you first took me in a boat
 five and you nearly were killed when i brought the fish in too green and he nearly tore the
boat to pieces can you remember
 i can remember the tail slapping and banging and the thwart breaking and the noise of the
clubbing i can remember you throwing me into the bow where the wet coiled lines were and feeling
the whole boat shiver and the noise of you clubbing him like chopping a tree down and the sweet
blood smell all over me
 can you really remember that or did i just tell it to you
 i remember everything from when we first went together
 the old man looked at him with his sunburned confident loving eyes
 if you were my boy id take you out and gamble he said but you are your fathers and your
mothers and you are in a lucky boat
 may i get the sardines i know where i can get four baits too
 i have mine left from today i put them in salt in the box
 let me get four fresh ones
 one the old man said his hope and his confidence had never gone but now they were
freshening as when the breeze rises
 two the boy said
 two the old man agreed you didnt steal them
 i would the boy said but i bought these
 thank you the old man said he was too simple to wonder when he had attained humility
but he knew he had attained it and he knew it was not disgraceful and it carried no loss of true
pride
 tomorrow is going to be a good day with this current he said
 where are you going the boy asked
 far out to come in when the wind shifts i want to be out before it is light
 ill try to get him to work far out the boy said then if you hook something truly big we can
come to your aid
 he does not like to work too far out
 no the boy said but i will see something that he cannot see such as a bird working and get
him to come out after dolphin
 are his eyes that bad
 he is almost blind
 it is strange the old man said he never went turtleing that is what kills the eyes
 but you went turtleing for years off the mosquito coast and your eyes are good
 i am a strange old man
 but are you strong enough now for a truly big fish
 i think so and there are many tricks
 let us take the stuff home the boy said so i can get the cast net and go after the
sardines
 they picked up the gear from the boat the old man carried the mast on his shoulder and the
boy carried the wooden boat with the coiled hardbraided brown lines the gaff and the harpoon
with its shaft the box with the baits was under the stern of the skiff along with the club that was
used to subdue the big fish when they were brought alongside no one would steal from the old
man but it was better to take the sail and the heavy lines home as the dew was bad for them and
though he was quite sure no local people would steal from him the old man thought that a gaff and
a harpoon were needless temptations to leave in a boat
 they walked up the road together to the old mans shack and went in through its open door
the old man leaned the mast with its wrapped sail against the wall and the boy put the box and the
other gear beside it the mast was nearly as long as the one room of the shack the shack was made
of the tough budshields of the royal palm which are called guano and in it there was a bed a table
one chair and a place on the dirt floor to cook with charcoal on the brown walls of the flattened
overlapping leaves of the sturdy fibered guano there was a picture in color of the sacred heart
of jesus and another of the virgin of cobre these were relics of his wife once there had been a
tinted photograph of his wife on the wall but he had taken it down because it made him too lonely
to see it and it was on the shelf in the corner under his clean shirt
 what do you have to eat the boy asked
 a pot of yellow rice with fish do you want some
 no i will eat at home do you want me to make the fire
 no i will make it later on or i may eat the rice cold
 may i take the cast net
 of course
 there was no cast net and the boy remembered when they had sold it but they went through
this fiction every day there was no pot of yellow rice and fish and the boy knew this too
 eightyfive is a lucky number the old man said how would you like to see me bring one in
that dressed out over a thousand pounds
 ill get the cast net and go for sardines will you sit in the sun in the doorway
 yes i have yesterdays paper and i will read the baseball
 the boy did not know whether yesterdays paper was a fiction too but the old man brought it
out from under the bed
 perico gave it to me at the bodega he explained ill be back when i have the sardines ill
keep yours and mine together on ice and we can share them in the morning when i come back you
can tell me about the baseball
 the yankees cannot lose
 but i fear the indians of cleveland
 have faith in the yankees my son think of the great dimaggio
 i fear both the tigers of detroit and the indians of cleveland
 be careful or you will fear even the reds of cincinnati and the white sax of chicago
 you study it and tell me when i come back
 do you think we should buy a terminal of the lottery with an eightyfive tomorrow is the
eightyfifth day
 we can do that the boy said but what about the eightyseven of your great record
 it could not happen twice do you think you can find an eightyfive
 i can order one
 one sheet thats two dollars and a half who can we borrow that from
 thats easy i can always borrow two dollars and a half
 i think perhaps i can too but i try not to borrow first you borrow then you beg
 keep warm old man the boy said remember we are in september
 the month when the great fish come the old man said anyone can be a fisherman in
may
 i go now for the sardines the boy said
 when the boy came back the old man was asleep in the chair and the sun was down the boy
took the old army blanket off the bed and spread it over the back of the chair and over the old
mans shoulders they were strange shoulders still powerful although very old and the neck was still
strong too and the creases did not show so much when the old man was asleep and his head fallen
forward his shirt had been patched so many times that it was like the sail and the patches were
faded to many different shades by the sun the old mans head was very old though and with
his eyes closed there was no life in his face the newspaper lay across his knees and the weight of his
arm held it there in the evening breeze he was barefooted
 the boy left him there and when he came back the old man was still asleep
 wake up old man the boy said and put his hand on one of the old mans knees
 the old man opened his eyes and for a moment he was coming back from a long way away
then he smiled
 what have you got he asked
 supper said the boy were going to have supper
 im not very hungry
 come on and eat you cant fish and not eat
 i have the old man said getting up and taking the newspaper and folding it then he started
to fold the blanket
 keep the blanket around you the boy said youll not fish without eating while im alive
 then live a long time and take care of yourself the old man said what are we eating
 black beans and rice fried bananas and some stew
 the boy had brought them in a twodecker metal container from the terrace the two sets
of knives and forks and spoons were in his pocket with a paper napkin wrapped around each set
 who gave this to you
 martin the owner
 i must thank him
 i thanked him already the boy said you dont need to thank him
 ill give him the belly meat of a big fish the old man said has he done this for us more than
once
 i think so
 i must give him something more than the belly meat then he is very thoughtful for us
 he sent two beers
 i like the beer in cans best
 i know but this is in bottles hatuey beer and i take back the bottles
 thats very kind of you the old man said should we eat
 ive been asking you to the boy told him gently i have not wished to open the container
until you were ready
 im ready now the old man said i only needed time to wash
 where did you wash the boy thought the village water supply was two streets down the road
i must have water here for him the boy thought and soap and a good towel why am i so
thoughtless i must get him another shirt and a jacket for the winter and some sort of shoes and
another blanket
 your stew is excellent the old man said
 tell me about the baseball the boy asked him
 in the american league it is the yankees as i said the old man said happily
 they lost today the boy told him
 that means nothing the great dimaggio is himself again
 they have other men on the team
 naturally but he makes the difference in the other league between brooklyn and
philadelphia i must take brooklyn but then i think of dick sisler and those great drives in the old
park
 there was nothing ever like them he hits the longest ball i have ever seen
 do you remember when he used to come to the terrace
 i wanted to take him fishing but i was too timid to ask him then i asked you to ask him
and you were too timid
 i know it was a great mistake he might have gone with us then we would have that for all
of our lives
 i would like to take the great dimaggio fishing the old man said they say his father was a
fisherman maybe he was as poor as we are and would understand
 the great sislers father was never poor and he the father was playing in the big leagues
when he was my age
 when i was your age i was before the mast on a square rigged ship that ran to africa and i
have seen lions on the beaches in the evening
 i know you told me
 should we talk about africa or about baseball
 baseball i think the boy said tell me about the great john j mcgraw he said jota for j
 he used to come to the terrace sometimes too in the older days but he was rough and harsh
spoken and difficult when he was drinking his mind was on horses as well as baseball at least he
carried lists of horses at all times in his pocket and frequently spoke the names of horses on the
telephone
 he was a great manager the boy said my father thinks he was the greatest
 because he came here the most times the old man said if durocher had continued to come
here each year your father would think him the greatest manager
 who is the greatest manager really luque or mike gonzalez
 i think they are equal
 and the best fisherman is you
 no i know others better
 que va the boy said there are many good fishermen and some great ones but there is
only you
 thank you you make me happy i hope no fish will come along so great that he will prove us
wrong
 there is no such fish if you are still strong as you say
 i may not be as strong as i think the old man said but i know many tricks and i have
resolution
 you ought to go to bed now so that you will be fresh in the morning i will take the things
back to the terrace
 good night then i will wake you in the morning
 youre my alarm clock the boy said
 age is my alarm clock the old man said why do old men wake so early is it to have one
longer day
 i dont know the boy said all i know is that young boys sleep late and hard
 i can remember it the old man said ill waken you in time
 i do not like for him to waken me it is as though i were inferior
 i know
 sleep well old man
 the boy went out they had eaten with no light on the table and the old man took off his
trousers and went to bed in the dark he rolled his trousers up to make a pillow putting the
newspaper inside them he rolled himself in the blanket and slept on the other old newspapers that
covered the springs of the bed
 he was asleep in a short time and he dreamed of africa when he was a boy and the long golden
beaches and the white beaches so white they hurt your eyes and the high capes and the great brown
mountains he lived along that coast now every night and in his dreams he heard the surf roar and
saw the native boats come riding through it he smelled the tar and oakum of the deck as he
slept and he smelled the smell of africa that the land breeze brought at morning
 usually when he smelled the land breeze he woke up and dressed to go and wake the boy but
tonight the smell of the land breeze came very early and he knew it was too early in his dream and
went on dreaming to see the white peaks of the islands rising from the sea and then he dreamed of
the different harbours and roadsteads of the canary islands
 he no longer dreamed of storms nor of women nor of great occurrences nor of great fish
nor fights nor contests of strength nor of his wife he only dreamed of places now and of the lions
on the beach they played like young cats in the dusk and he loved them as he loved the boy he
never dreamed about the boy he simply woke looked out the open door at the moon and unrolled
his trousers and put them on he urinated outside the shack and then went up the road to wake the
boy he was shivering with the morning cold but he knew he would shiver himself warm and that
soon he would be rowing
 the door of the house where the boy lived was unlocked and he opened it and walked in quietly
with his bare feet the boy was asleep on a cot in the first room and the old man could see him
clearly with the light that came in from the dying moon he took hold of one foot gently and held it
until the boy woke and turned and looked at him the old man nodded and the boy took his
trousers from the chair by the bed and sitting on the bed pulled them on
 the old man went out the door and the boy came after him he was sleepy and the old man put
his arm across his shoulders and said i am sorry
 qua va the boy said it is what a man must do
 they walked down the road to the old mans shack and all along the road in the dark barefoot
men were moving carrying the masts of their boats
 when they reached the old mans shack the boy took the rolls of line in the basket and the
harpoon and gaff and the old man carried the mast with the furled sail on his shoulder
 do you want coffee the boy asked
 well put the gear in the boat and then get some
 they had coffee from condensed milk cans at an early morning place that served fishermen
 how did you sleep old man the boy asked he was waking up now although it was still
hard for him to leave his sleep
 very well manolin the old man said i feel confident today
 so do i the boy said now i must get your sardines and mine and your fresh baits he
brings our gear himself he never wants anyone to carry anything
 were different the old man said i let you carry things when you were five years old
 i know it the boy said ill be right back have another coffee we have credit here
 he walked off barefooted on the coral rocks to the ice house where the baits were stored
 the old man drank his coffee slowly it was all he would have all day and he knew that he
should take it for a long time now eating had bored him and he never carried a lunch he had a
bottle of water in the bow of the skiff and that was all he needed for the day
 the boy was back now with the sardines and the two baits wrapped in a newspaper and they
went down the trail to the skiff feeling the pebbled sand under their feet and lifted the skiff and slid
her into the water
 good luck old man
 good luck the old man said he fitted the rope lashings of the oars onto the thole pins and
leaning forward against the thrust of the blades in the water he began to row out of the harbour in
the dark there were other boats from the other beaches going out to sea and the old man heard the
dip and push of their oars even though he could not see them now the moon was below the hills
 sometimes someone would speak in a boat but most of the boats were silent except for the dip
of the oars they spread apart after they were out of the mouth of the harbour and each one headed
for the part of the ocean where he hoped to find fish the old man knew he was going far out and
he left the smell of the land behind and rowed out into the clean early morning smell of the ocean
he saw the phosphorescence of the gulf weed in the water as he rowed over the part of the ocean
that the fishermen called the great well because there was a sudden deep of seven hundred fathoms
where all sorts of fish congregated because of the swirl the current made against the steep walls of
the floor of the ocean here there were concentrations of shrimp and bait fish and sometimes
schools of squid in the deepest holes and these rose close to the surface at night where all the
wandering fish fed on them
 in the dark the old man could feel the morning coming and as he rowed he heard the trembling
sound as flying fish left the water and the hissing that their stiff set wings made as they soared away
in the darkness he was very fond of flying fish as they were his principal friends on the ocean he
was sorry for the birds especially the small delicate dark terns that were always flying and looking
and almost never finding and he thought the birds have a harder life than we do except for the
robber birds and the heavy strong ones why did they make birds so delicate and fine as those sea
swallows when the ocean can be so cruel she is kind and very beautiful but she can be so cruel and
it comes so suddenly and such birds that fly dipping and hunting with their small sad voices are
made too delicately for the sea
 he always thought of the sea as la mar which is what people call her in spanish when they love
her sometimes those who love her say bad things of her but they are always said as though she were
a woman some of the younger fishermen those who used buoys as floats for their lines and had
motorboats bought when the shark livers had brought much money spoke of her as el mar
which is masculine they spoke of her as a contestant or a place or even an enemy but the old man
always thought of her as feminine and as something that gave or withheld great favours and if she
did wild or wicked things it was because she could not help them the moon affects her as it does a
woman he thought
 he was rowing steadily and it was no effort for him since he kept well within his speed and the
surface of the ocean was flat except for the occasional swirls of the current he was letting the
current do a third of the work and as it started to be light he saw he was already further out than he
had hoped to be at this hour
 i worked the deep wells for a week and did nothing he thought today ill work out where the
schools of bonito and albacore are and maybe there will be a big one with them
 before it was really light he had his baits out and was drifting with the current one bait was
down forty fathoms the second was at seventyfive and the third and fourth were down in the blue
water at one hundred and one hundred and twentyfive fathoms each bait hung head down
with the shank of the hook inside the bait fish tied and sewed solid and all the projecting part of the
hook the curve and the point was covered with fresh sardines each sardine was hooked through
both eyes so that they made a halfgarland on the projecting steel there was no part of the hook
that a great fish could feel which was not sweet smelling and good tasting
 the boy had given him two fresh small tunas or albacores which hung on the two deepest
lines like plummets and on the others he had a big blue runner and a yellow jack that had been used
before but they were in good condition still and had the excellent sardines to give them scent and
attractiveness each line as thick around as a big pencil was looped onto a greensapped stick so
that any pull or touch on the bait would make the stick dip and each line had two fortyfathom coils
which could be made fast to the other spare coils so that if it were necessary a fish could take out
over three hundred fathoms of line
 now the man watched the dip of the three sticks over the side of the skiff and rowed gently to
keep the lines straight up and down and at their proper depths it was quite light and any
moment now the sun would rise
 the sun rose thinly from the sea and the old man could see the other boats low on the water
and well in toward the shore spread out across the current then the sun was brighter and the glare
came on the water and then as it rose clear the flat sea sent it back at his eyes so that it hurt sharply
and he rowed without looking into it he looked down into the water and watched the lines that
went straight down into the dark of the water he kept them straighter than anyone did so that at
each level in the darkness of the stream there would be a bait waiting exactly where he wished it to
be for any fish that swam there others let them drift with the current and sometimes they were at
sixty fathoms when the fishermen thought they were at a hundred
 but he thought i keep them with precision only i have no luck any more but who knows
maybe today every day is a new day it is better to be lucky but i would rather be exact then
when luck comes you are ready
 the sun was two hours higher now and it did not hurt his eyes so much to look into the
east there were only three boats in sight now and they showed very low and far inshore
 all my life the early sun has hurt my eyes he thought yet they are still good in the evening i
can look straight into it without getting the blackness it has more force in the evening too but in
the morning it is painful
 just then he saw a manofwar bird with his long black wings circling in the sky ahead of him
he made a quick drop slanting down on his backswept wings and then circled again
 hes got something the old man said aloud hes not just looking
 he rowed slowly and steadily toward where the bird was circling he did not hurry and he kept
his lines straight up and down but he crowded the current a little so that he was still fishing
correctly though faster than he would have fished if he was not trying to use the bird
 the bird went higher in the air and circled again his wings motionless then he dove suddenly
and the old man saw flying fish spurt out of the water and sail desperately over the surface
 dolphin the old man said aloud big dolphin
 he shipped his oars and brought a small line from under the bow it had a wire leader and a
mediumsized hook and he baited it with one of the sardines he let it go over the side and then
made it fast to a ring bolt in the stern then he baited another line and left it coiled in the shade of
the bow he went back to rowing and to watching the longwinged black bird who was working
now low over the water
 as he watched the bird dipped again slanting his wings for the dive and then swinging them
wildly and ineffectually as he followed the flying fish the old man could see the slight bulge in the
water that the big dolphin raised as they followed the escaping fish the dolphin were cutting
through the water below the flight of the fish and would be in the water driving at speed when the
fish dropped it is a big school of dolphin he thought they are widespread and the flying fish have
little chance the bird has no chance the flying fish are too big for him and they go too fast
 he watched the flying fish burst out again and again and the ineffectual movements of the bird
that school has gotten away from me he thought they are moving out too fast and too far but
perhaps i will pick up a stray and perhaps my big fish is around them my big fish must be
somewhere
 the clouds over the land now rose like mountains and the coast was only a long green line with
the gray blue hills behind it the water was a dark blue now so dark that it was almost purple as he
looked down into it he saw the red sifting of the plankton in the dark water and the strange light the
sun made now he watched his lines to see them go straight down out of sight into the water and he
was happy to see so much plankton because it meant fish the strange light the sun made in the
water now that the sun was higher meant good weather and so did the shape of the clouds over the
land but the bird was almost out of sight now and nothing showed on the surface of the water but
some patches of yellow sunbleached sargasso weed and the purple formalized iridescent
gelatinous bladder of a portuguese manofwar floating dose beside the boat it turned on its side
and then righted itself it floated cheerfully as a bubble with its long deadly purple filaments trailing
a yard behind it in the water
 agua mala the man said you whore
 from where he swung lightly against his oars he looked down into the water and saw the tiny
fish that were coloured like the trailing filaments and swam between them and under the small
shade the bubble made as it drifted they were immune to its poison but men were not and when
same of the filaments would catch on a line and rest there slimy and purple while the old man was
working a fish he would have welts and sores on his arms and hands of the sort that poison ivy or
poison oak can give but these poisonings from the agua mala came quickly and struck like a
whiplash
 the iridescent bubbles were beautiful but they were the falsest thing in the sea and the old man
loved to see the big sea turtles eating them the turtles saw them approached them from the front
then shut their eyes so they were completely carapaced and ate them filaments and all the old man
loved to see the turtles eat them and he loved to walk on them on the beach after a storm and hear
them pop when he stepped on them with the horny soles of his feet
 he loved green turtles and hawkbills with their elegance and speed and their great value and he
had a friendly contempt for the huge stupid loggerheads yellow in their armourplating strange in
their lovemaking and happily eating the portuguese menofwar with their eyes shut
 he had no mysticism about turtles although he had gone in turtle boats for many years he was
sorry for them all even the great trunk backs that were as long as the skiff and weighed a ton most
people are heartless about turtles because a turtles heart will beat for hours after he has been cut up
and butchered but the old man thought i have such a heart too and my feet and hands are like
theirs he ate the white eggs to give himself strength he ate them all through may to be strong in
september and october for the truly big fish
 he also drank a cup of shark liver oil each day from the big drum in the shack where many of
the fishermen kept their gear it was there for all fishermen who wanted it most fishermen hated
the taste but it was no worse than getting up at the hours that they rose and it was very good against
all colds and grippes and it was good for the eyes
 now the old man looked up and saw that the bird was circling again
 hes found fish he said aloud no flying fish broke the surface and there was no scattering of
bait fish but as the old man watched a small tuna rose in the air turned and dropped head first
into the water the tuna shone silver in the sun and after he had dropped back into the water
another and another rose and they were jumping in all directions churning the water and leaping in
long jumps after the bait they were circling it and driving it
 if they dont travel too fast i will get into them the old man thought and he watched the
school working the water white and the bird now dropping and dipping into the bait fish that were
forced to the surface in their panic
 the bird is a great help the old man said just then the stern line came taut under his foot
where he had kept a loop of the line and he dropped his oars and felt tile weight of the small tunas
shivering pull as he held the line firm and commenced to haul it in the shivering increased as he
pulled in and he could see the blue back of the fish in the water and the gold of his sides before he
swung him over the side and into the boat he lay in the stern in the sun compact and bullet
shaped his big unintelligent eyes staring as he thumped his life out against the planking of the boat
with the quick shivering strokes of his neat fastmoving tail the old man hit him on the head
for kindness and kicked him his body still shuddering under the shade of the stern
 albacore he said aloud hell make a beautiful bait hell weigh ten pounds
 he did not remember when he had first started to talk aloud when he was by himself he had
sung when he was by himself in the old days and he had sung at night sometimes when he was alone
steering on his watch in the smacks or in the turtle boats he had probably started to talk aloud
when alone when the boy had left but he did not remember when he and the boy fished together
they usually spoke only when it was necessary they talked at night or when they were stormbound
by bad weather it was considered a virtue not to talk unnecessarily at sea and the old man had
always considered it so and respected it but now he said his thoughts aloud many times since there
was no one that they could annoy
 if the others heard me talking out loud they would think that i am crazy he said aloud but
since i am not crazy i do not care and the rich have radios to talk to them in their boats and to
bring them the baseball
 now is no time to think of baseball he thought now is the time to think of only one
thing that which i was born for there might be a big one around that school he thought i picked
up only a straggler from the albacore that were feeding but they are working far out and fast
everything that shows on the surface today travels very fast and to the northeast can that be the
time of day or is it some sign of weather that i do not know
 he could not see the green of the shore now but only the tops of the blue hills that showed
white as though they were snowcapped and the clouds that looked like high snow mountains above
them the sea was very dark and the light made prisms in the water the myriad flecks of the
plankton were annulled now by the high sun and it was only the great deep prisms in the blue water
that the old man saw now with his lines going straight down into the water that was a mile deep
 the tuna the fishermen called all the fish of that species tuna and only distinguished among
them by their proper names when they came to sell them or to trade them for baits were down
again the sun was hot now and the old man felt it on the back of his neck and felt the sweat
trickle down his back as he rowed
 i could just drift he thought and sleep and put a bight of line around my toe to wake me but
today is eightyfive days and i should fish the day well
 just then watching his lines he saw one of the projecting green sticks dip sharply
 yes he said yes and shipped his oars without bumping the boat he reached out for the
line and held it softly between the thumb and forefinger of his right hand he felt no strain nor
weight and he held the line lightly then it came again this time it was a tentative pull not solid nor
heavy and he knew exactly what it was one hundred fathoms down a marlin was eating the
sardines that covered the point and the shank of the hook where the handforged hook projected
from the head of the small tuna
 the old man held the line delicately and softly with his left hand unleashed it from the stick
now he could let it run through his fingers without the fish feeling any tension
 this far out he must be huge in this month he thought eat them fish eat them please eat
them
 how fresh they are and you down there six hundred feet in that cold water in the dark
make another turn in the dark and come back and eat them
 he felt the light delicate pulling and then a harder pull when a sardines head must have been
more difficult to break from the hook then there was nothing
 come on the old man said aloud make another turn just smell them arent they lovely
eat them good now and then there is the tuna hard and cold and lovely dont be shy fish eat
them
 he waited with the line between his thumb and his finger watching it and the other lines at the
same time for the fish might have swum up or down then came the same delicate pulling touch
again
 hell take it the old man said aloud god help him to take it
 he did not take it though he was gone and the old man felt nothing
 he cant have gone he said christ knows he cant have gone hes making a turn maybe he
has been hooked before and he remembers something of it
 then he felt the gentle touch on the line and he was happy
 it was only his turn he said hell take it
 he was happy feeling the gentle pulling and then he felt something hard and unbelievably
heavy it was the weight of the fish and he let the line slip down down down unrolling off the first
of the two reserve coils as it went down slipping lightly through the old mans fingers he still
could feel the great weight though the pressure of his thumb and finger were almost imperceptible
 what a fish he said he has it sideways in his mouth now and he is moving off with it
 then he will turn and swallow it he thought he did not say that because he knew that if you
said a good thing it might not happen he knew what a huge fish this was and he thought of him
moving away in the darkness with the tuna held crosswise in his mouth at that moment he felt him
stop moving but the weight was still there then the weight increased and he gave more line he
tightened the pressure of his thumb and finger for a moment and the weight increased and was
going straight down
 hes taken it he said now ill let him eat it well
 he let the line slip through his fingers while he reached down with his left hand and made fast
the free end of the two reserve coils to the loop of the two reserve coils of the next line now he
was ready he had three fortyfathom coils of line in reserve now as well as the coil he was using
 eat it a little more he said eat it well
 eat it so that the point of the hook goes into your heart and kills you he thought come up
easy and let me put the harpoon into you all right are you ready have you been long enough at
table
 now he said aloud and struck hard with both hands gained a yard of line and then struck
again and again swinging with each arm alternately on the cord with all the strength of his arms and
the pivoted weight of his body
 nothing happened the fish just moved away slowly and the old man could not raise him an
inch his line was strong and made for heavy fish and he held it against his hack until it was so taut
that beads of water were jumping from it then it began to make a slow hissing sound in the water
and he still held it bracing himself against the thwart and leaning back against the pull the boat
began to move slowly off toward the northwest
 the fish moved steadily and they travelled slowly on the calm water the other baits were still
in the water but there was nothing to be done
 i wish i had the boy the old man said aloud im being towed by a fish and im the towing
bitt i could make the line fast but then he could break it i must hold him all i can and give him
line when he must have it thank god he is travelling and not going down
 what i will do if he decides to go down i dont know what ill do if he sounds and dies i
dont know but ill do something there are plenty of things i can do
 he held the line against his back and watched its slant in the water and the skiff moving steadily
to the northwest
 this will kill him the old man thought he cant do this forever but four hours later the fish
was still swimming steadily out to sea towing the skiff and the old man was still braced solidly with
the line across his back
 it was noon when i hooked him he said and i have never seen him
 he had pushed his straw hat hard down on his head before he hooked the fish and it was
cutting his forehead he was thirsty too and he got down on his knees and being careful not to jerk
on the line moved as far into the bow as he could get and reached the water bottle with one hand
he opened it and drank a little then he rested against the bow he rested sitting on the unstepped
mast and sail and tried not to think but only to endure
 then he looked behind him and saw that no land was visible that makes no difference he
thought i can always come in on the glow from havana there are two more hours before the sun
sets and maybe he will come up before that if he doesnt maybe he will come up with the moon if
he does not do that maybe he will come up with the sunrise i have no cramps and i feel strong it is
he that has the hook in his mouth but what a fish to pull like that he must have his mouth shut
tight on the wire i wish i could see him i wish i could see him only once to know what i have
against me
 the fish never changed his course nor his direction all that night as far as the man could
tell from watching the stars it was cold after the sun went down and the old mans sweat dried cold
on his back and his arms and his old legs during the day he had taken the sack that covered the bait
box and spread it in the sun to dry after the sun went down he tied it around his neck so that it
hung down over his back and he cautiously worked it down under the line that was across his
shoulders now the sack cushioned the line and he had found a way of leaning forward against the
bow so that he was almost comfortable the position actually was only somewhat less intolerable
but he thought of it as almost comfortable
 i can do nothing with him and he can do nothing with me he thought not as long as he keeps
this up
 once he stood up and urinated over the side of the skiff and looked at the stars and checked his
course the line showed like a phosphorescent streak in the water straight out from his shoulders
they were moving more slowly now and the glow of havana was not so strong so that he knew the
current must be carrying them to the eastward if i lose the glare of havana we must be going more
to the eastward he thought for if the fishs course held true i must see it for many more hours
i wonder how the baseball came out in the grand leagues today he thought it would be wonderful
to do this with a radio then he thought think of it always think of what you are doing you must
do nothing stupid
 then he said aloud i wish i had the boy to help me and to see this
 no one should be alone in their old age he thought but it is unavoidable i must remember to
eat the tuna before he spoils in order to keep strong remember no matter how little you want to
that you must eat him in the morning remember he said to himself
 during the night two porpoises came around the boat and he could hear them rolling and
blowing he could tell the difference between the blowing noise the male made and the sighing blow
of the female
 they are good he said they play and make jokes and love one another they are our
brothers like the flying fish
 then he began to pity the great fish that he had hooked he is wonderful and strange and who
knows how old he is he thought never have i had such a strong fish nor one who acted so
strangely perhaps he is too wise to jump he could ruin me by jumping or by a wild rush but
perhaps he has been hooked many times before and he knows that this is how he should make his
fight he cannot know that it is only one man against him nor that it is an old man but what a great
fish he is and what will he bring in the market if the flesh is good he took the bait like a male and
he pulls like a male and his fight has no panic in it i wonder if he has any plans or if he is just as
desperate as i am
 he remembered the time he had hooked one of a pair of marlin the male fish always let the
female fish feed first and the hooked fish the female made a wild panicstricken despairing fight
that soon exhausted her and all the time the male had stayed with her crossing the line and circling
with her on the surface he had stayed so close that the old man was afraid he would cut the line
with his tail which was sharp as a scythe and almost of that size and shape when the old man had
gaffed her and clubbed her holding the rapier bill with its sandpaper edge and dubbing her across
the top of her head until her colour turned to a colour almost like the backing of mirrors and then
with the boys aid hoisted her aboard the male fish had stayed by the side of the boat then while
the old man was clearing the lines and preparing the harpoon the male fish jumped high into
the air beside the boat to see where the female was and then went down deep his lavender wings
that were his pectoral fins spread wide and all his wide lavender stripes showing he was beautiful
the old man remembered and he had stayed
 that was the saddest thing i ever saw with them the old man thought the boy was sad too
and we begged her pardon and butchered her promptly
 i wish the boy was here he said aloud and settled himself against the rounded planks of the
bow and felt the strength of the great fish through the line he held across his shoulders moving
steadily toward whatever he had chosen
 when once through my treachery it had been necessary to him to make a choice the old man
thought
 his choice had been to stay in the deep dark water far out beyond all snares and traps and
treacheries my choice was to go there to find him beyond all people beyond all people in the
world now we are joined together and have been since noon and no one to help either one of us
 perhaps i should not have been a fisherman he thought but that was the thing that i was born
for i must surely remember to eat the tuna after it gets light
 some time before daylight something took one of the baits that were behind him he heard
the stick break and the line begin to rush out over the gunwale of the skiff in the darkness he
loosened his sheath knife and taking all the strain of the fish on his left shoulder he leaned back and
cut the line against the wood of the gunwale then he cut the other line closest to him and in the
dark made the loose ends of the reserve coils fast he worked skillfully with the one hand and put
his foot on the coils to hold them as he drew his knots tight now he had six reserve coils of line
there were two from each bait he had severed and the two from the bait the fish had taken and they
were all connected
 after it is light he thought i will work back to the fortyfathom bait and cut it away too and
link up the reserve coils i will have lost two hundred fathoms of good catalan cardel and the hooks
and leaders that can be replaced but who replaces this fish if i hook some fish and it cuts him off
i dont know what that fish was that took the bait just now it could have been a marlin or a
broadbill or a shark i never felt him i had to get rid of him too fast
 aloud he said i wish i had the boy
 but you havent got the boy he thought you have only yourself and you had better work
back to the last line now in the dark or not in the dark and cut it away and hook up the two reserve
coils
 so he did it it was difficult in the dark and once the fish made a surge that pulled him down on
his face and made a cut below his eye the blood ran down his cheek a little way but it coagulated
and dried before it reached his chin and he worked his way back to the bow and rested against the
wood he adjusted the sack and carefully worked the line so that it came across a new part of his
shoulders and holding it anchored with his shoulders he carefully felt the pull of the fish and then
felt with his hand the progress of the skiff through the water
 i wonder what he made that lurch for he thought the wire must have slipped on the great hill
of his back certainly his back cannot feel as badly as mine does but he cannot pull this skiff
forever no matter how great he is now everything is cleared away that might make trouble and i
have a big reserve of line all that a man can ask
 fish he said softly aloud ill stay with you until i am dead
 hell stay with me too i suppose the old man thought and he waited for it to be light it
was cold now in the time before daylight and he pushed against the wood to be warm i can do it as
long as he can he thought and in the first light the line extended out and down into the water the
boat moved steadily and when the first edge of the sun rose it was on the old mans right shoulder
 hes headed north the old man said the current will have set us far to the eastward he
thought i wish he would turn with the current that would show that he was tiring
 when the sun had risen further the old man realized that the fish was not tiring there was only
one favorable sign the slant of the line showed he was swimming at a lesser depth that did not
necessarily mean that he would jump but he might
 god let him jump the old man said i have enough line to handle him
 maybe if i can increase the tension just a little it will hurt him and he will jump he thought
now that it is daylight let him jump so that hell fill the sacks along his backbone with air and then
he cannot go deep to die
 he tried to increase the tension but the line had been taut up to the very edge of the
breaking point since he had hooked the fish and he felt the harshness as he leaned back to pull and
knew he could put no more strain on it i must not jerk it ever he thought each jerk widens the cut
the hook makes and then when he does jump he might throw it anyway i feel better with the sun
and for once i do not have to look into it
 there was yellow weed on the line but the old man knew that only made an added drag and he
was pleased it was the yellow gulf weed that had made so much phosphorescence in the night
 fish he said i love you and respect you very much but i will kill you dead before this day
ends
 let us hope so he thought
 a small bird came toward the skiff from the north he was a warbler and flying very low over
the water the old man could see that he was very tired
 the bird made the stern of the boat and rested there then he flew around the old mans head
and rested on the line where he was more comfortable
 how old are you the old man asked the bird is this your first trip
 the bird looked at him when he spoke he was too tired even to examine the line and he
teetered on it as his delicate feet gripped it fast
 its steady the old man told him its too steady you shouldnt be that tired after a windless
night what are birds coming to
 the hawks he thought that come out to sea to meet them but he said nothing of this to the
bird who could not understand him anyway and who would learn about the hawks soon enough
 take a good rest small bird he said then go in and take your chance like any man or bird
or fish
 it encouraged him to talk because his back had stiffened in the night and it hurt truly now
 stay at my house if you like bird he said i am sorry i cannot hoist the sail and take you in
with the small breeze that is rising but i am with a friend
 just then the fish gave a sudden lurch that pulled the old man down onto the bow and would
have pulled him overboard if he had not braced himself and given some line
 the bird had flown up when the line jerked and the old man had not even seen him go he felt
the line carefully with his right hand and noticed his hand was bleeding
 something hurt him then he said aloud and pulled back on the line to see if he could turn the
fish but when he was touching the breaking point he held steady and settled back against the strain
of the line
 youre feeling it now fish he said and so god knows am i
 he looked around for the bird now because he would have liked him for company the bird
was gone
 you did not stay long the man thought but it is rougher where you are going until you make
the shore how did i let the fish cut me with that one quick pull he made i must be getting very
stupid or perhaps i was looking at the small bird and thinking of him now i will pay attention to
my work and then i must eat the tuna so that i will not have a failure of strength
 i wish the boy were here and that i had some salt he said aloud
 shifting the weight of the line to his left shoulder and kneeling carefully he washed his hand in
the ocean and held it there submerged for more than a minute watching the blood trail away
and the steady movement of the water against his hand as the boat moved
 he has slowed much he said
 the old man would have liked to keep his hand in the salt water longer but he was afraid of
another sudden lurch by the fish and he stood up and braced himself and held his hand up against
the sun it was only a line burn that had cut his flesh but it was in the working part of his hand he
knew he would need his hands before this was over and he did not like to be cut before it started
 now he said when his hand had dried i must eat the small tuna i can reach him with the
gaff and eat him here in comfort
 he knelt down and found the tuna under the stem with the gaff and drew it toward him
keeping it clear of the coiled lines holding the line with his left shoulder again and bracing on his
left hand and arm he took the tuna off the gaff hook and put the gaff back in place he put one
knee on the fish and cut strips of dark red meat longitudinally from the back of the head to the tail
they were wedgeshaped strips and he cut them from next to the back bone down to the edge
of the belly when he had cut six strips he spread them out on the wood of the bow wiped his knife
on his trousers and lifted the carcass of the bonito by the tail and dropped it overboard
 i dont think i can eat an entire one he said and drew his knife across one of the strips he
could feel the steady hard pull of the line and his left hand was cramped it drew up tight on the
heavy cord and he looked at it in disgust
 what kind of a hand is that he said cramp then if you want make yourself into a claw it
will do you no good
 come on he thought and looked down into the dark water at the slant of the line eat it now
and it will strengthen the hand it is not the hands fault and you have been many hours with the
fish but you can stay with him forever eat the bonito now
 he picked up a piece and put it in his mouth and chewed it slowly it was not unpleasant
 chew it well he thought and get all the juices it would not be had to eat with a little lime or
with lemon or with salt
 how do you feel hand he asked the cramped hand that was almost as stiff as rigor
mortis ill eat some more for you
 he ate the other part of the piece that he had cut in two he chewed it carefully and then spat
out the skin
 how does it go hand or is it too early to know
 he took another full piece and chewed it
 it is a strong fullblooded fish he thought i was lucky to get him instead of dolphin
dolphin is too sweet this is hardly sweet at all and all the strength is still in it
 there is no sense in being anything but practical though he thought i wish i had some salt
and i do not know whether the sun will rot or dry what is left so i had better eat it all although i
am not hungry the fish is calm and steady i will eat it all and then i will be ready
 be patient hand he said i do this for you
 i wish i could feed the fish he thought he is my brother but i must kill him and keep strong
to do it slowly and conscientiously he ate all of the wedgeshaped strips of fish
 he straightened up wiping his hand on his trousers now he said you can let the cord go
hand and i will handle him with the right arm alone until you stop that nonsense he put his
left foot on the heavy line that the left hand had held and lay back against the pull against his back
 god help me to have the cramp go he said because i do not know what the fish is going to
do
 but he seems calm he thought and following his plan but what is his plan he thought and
what is mine mine i must improvise to his because of his great size if he will jump i can kill him
but he stays down forever then i will stay down with him forever
 he rubbed the cramped hand against his trousers and tried to gentle the fingers but it would
not open maybe it will open with the sun he thought maybe it will open when the strong raw tuna
is digested if i have to have it i will open it cost whatever it costs but i do not want to open it
now by force let it open by itself and come back of its own accord after all i abused it much in
the night when it was necessary to free and untie the various lines
 he looked across the sea and knew how alone he was now but he could see the prisms in the
deep dark water and the line stretching ahead and the strange undulation of the calm the clouds
were building up now for the trade wind and he looked ahead and saw a flight of wild ducks
etching themselves against the sky over the water then blurring then etching again and he knew no
man was ever alone on the sea
 he thought of how some men feared being out of sight of land in a small boar and knew they
were right in the months of sudden bad weather but now they were in hurricane months and when
there are no hurricanes the weather of hurricane months is the best of all the year
 if there is a hurricane you always see the signs of it in the sky for days ahead if you are at sea
they do not see it ashore because they do not know what to look for he thought the land must
make a difference too in the shape of the clouds but we have no hurricane coming now
 he looked at the sky and saw the white cumulus built like friendly piles of ice cream and high
above were the thin feathers of the cirrus against the high september sky
 light brisa he said better weather for me than for you fish
 his left hand was still cramped but he was unknotting it slowly
 i hate a cramp he thought it is a treachery of ones own body it is humiliating before
others to have a diarrhoea from ptomaine poisoning or to vomit from it but a cramp he thought of
it as a calambre humiliates oneself especially when one is alone
 if the boy were here he could rub it for me and loosen it down from the forearm he thought
but it will loosen up
 then with his right hand he felt the difference in the pull of the line before he saw the slant
change in the water then as he leaned against the line and slapped his left hand hard and fast
against his thigh he saw the line slanting slowly upward
 hes coming up he said come on hand please come on
 the line rose slowly and steadily and then the surface of the ocean bulged ahead of the boat and
the fish came out he came out unendingly and water poured from his sides he was bright in the
sun and his head and back were dark purple and in the sun the stripes on his sides showed wide and
a light lavender his sword was as long as a baseball bat and tapered like a rapier and he rose his full
length from the water and then reentered it smoothly like a diver and the old man saw the
great scytheblade of his tail go under and the line commenced to race out
 he is two feet longer than the skiff the old man said the line was going out fast but steadily
and the fish was not panicked the old man was trying with both hands to keep the line just inside
of breaking strength he knew that if he could not slow the fish with a steady pressure the fish could
take out all the line and break it
 he is a great fish and i must convince him he thought i must never let him learn his strength
nor what he could do if he made his run if i were him i would put in everything now and go until
something broke but thank god they are not as intelligent as we who kill them although they are
more noble and more able
 the old man had seen many great fish he had seen many that weighed more than a thousand
pounds and he had caught two of that size in his life but never alone now alone and out of sight
of land he was fast to the biggest fish that he had ever seen and bigger than he had ever heard of
and his left hand was still as tight as the gripped claws of an eagle
 it will uncramp though he thought surely it will uncramp to help my right hand there are
three things that are brothers the fish and my two hands it must uncramp it is unworthy of it to be
cramped the fish had slowed again and was going at his usual pace
 i wonder why he jumped the old man thought he jumped almost as though to show me how
big he was i know now anyway he thought i wish i could show him what sort of man i am but
then he would see the cramped hand let him think i am more man than i am and i will be so i
wish i was the fish he thought with everything he has against only my will and my intelligence
 he settled comfortably against the wood and took his suffering as it came and the fish swam
steadily and the boat moved slowly through the dark water there was a small sea rising with the
wind coming up from the east and at noon the old mans left hand was uncramped
 bad news for you fish he said and shifted the line over the sacks that covered his shoulders
 he was comfortable but suffering although he did not admit the suffering at all
 i am not religious he said but i will say ten our fathers and ten hail marys that i
should catch this fish and i promise to make a pilgrimage to the virgin of cobre if i catch him
that is a promise
 he commenced to say his prayers mechanically sometimes he would be so tired that he could
not remember the prayer and then he would say them fast so that they would come automatically
hail marys are easier to say than our fathers he thought
 hail mary full of grace the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and blessed is
the fruit of thy womb jesus holy mary mother of god pray for us sinners now and at the hour of
our death amen then he added blessed virgin pray for the death of this fish wonderful
though he is
 with his prayers said and feeling much better but suffering exactly as much and perhaps a
little more he leaned against the wood of the bow and began mechanically to work the fingers of
his left hand
 the sun was hot now although the breeze was rising gently
 i had better rebait that little line out over the stern he said if the fish decides to stay
another night i will need to eat again and the water is low in the bottle i dont think i can get
anything but a dolphin here but if i eat him fresh enough he wont be bad i wish a flying fish
would come on board tonight but i have no light to attract them a flying fish is excellent to eat
raw and i would not have to cut him up i must save all my strength now christ i did not know he
was so big
 ill kill him though he said in all his greatness and his glory
 although it is unjust he thought but i will show him what a man can do and what a man
endures
 i told the boy i was a strange old man he said
 now is when i must prove it
 the thousand times that he had proved it meant nothing now he was proving it again each
time was a new time and he never thought about the past when he was doing it
 i wish hed sleep and i could sleep and dream about the lions he thought why are the lions the
main thing that is left dont think old man he said to himself rest gently now against the wood
and think of nothing he is working work as little as you can
 it was getting into the afternoon and the boat still moved slowly and steadily but there was an
added drag now from the easterly breeze and the old man rode gently with the small sea and the
hurt of the cord across his back came to him easily and smoothly
 once in the afternoon the line started to rise again but the fish only continued to swim at a
slightly higher level the sun was on the old mans left arm and shoulder and on his back so he
knew the fish had turned east of north
 now that he had seen him once he could picture the fish swimming in the water with his
purple pectoral fins set wide as wings and the great erect tail slicing through the dark i wonder how
much he sees at that depth the old man thought his eye is huge and a horse with much less eye
can see in the dark once i could see quite well in the dark not in the absolute dark but almost as a
cat sees
 the sun and his steady movement of his fingers had uncramped his left hand now completely
and he began to shift more of the strain to it and he shrugged the muscles of his back to shift the
hurt of the cord a little
 if youre not tired fish he said aloud you must be very strange
 he felt very tired now and he knew the night would come soon and he tried to think of other
things he thought of the big leagues to him they were the gran ligas and he knew that the
yankees of new york were playing the tigres of detroit
 this is the second day now that i do not know the result of the juegos he thought but i must
have confidence and i must be worthy of the great dimaggio who does all things perfectly even
with the pain of the bone spur in his heel what is a bone spur he asked himself un espuela de hueso
we do not have them can it be as painful as the spur of a fighting cock in ones heel i do not think
i could endure that or the loss of the eye and of both eyes and continue to fight as the fighting cocks
do man is not much beside the great birds and beasts still i would rather be that beast down there
in the darkness of the sea
 unless sharks come he said aloud if sharks come god pity him and me
 do you believe the great dimaggio would stay with a fish as long as i will stay with this one he
thought i am sure he would and more since he is young and strong also his father was a fisherman
but would the bone spur hurt him too much
 i do not know he said aloud i never had a bone spur
 as the sun set he remembered to give himself more confidence the time in the tavern at
casablanca when he had played the hand game with the great negro from cienfuegos who was the
strongest man on the docks they had gone one day and one night with their elbows on a chalk line
on the table and their forearms straight up and their hands gripped tight each one was trying to
force the others hand down onto the table there was much betting and people went in and out of
the room under the kerosene lights and he had looked at the arm and hand of the negro and at the
negros face they changed the referees every four hours after the first eight so that the referees
could sleep blood came out from under the fingernails of both his and the negros hands and they
looked each other in the eye and at their hands and forearms and the bettors went in and out of the
room and sat on high chairs against the wall and watched the walls were painted bright blue and
were of wood and the lamps threw their shadows against them the negros shadow was huge and it
moved on the wall as the breeze moved the lamps
 the odds would change back and forth all night and they fed the negro rum and lighted
cigarettes for him
 then the negro after the rum would try for a tremendous effort and once he had the old
man who was not an old man then but was santiago el campeon nearly three inches off balance
but the old man had raised his hand up to dead even again he was sure then that he had the negro
who was a fine man and a great athlete beaten and at daylight when the bettors were asking that it
be called a draw and the referee was shaking his head he had unleashed his effort and forced the
hand of the negro down and down until it rested on the wood the match had started on a sunday
morning and ended on a monday morning many of the bettors had asked for a draw because they
had to go to work on the docks loading sacks of sugar or at the havana coal company otherwise
everyone would have wanted it to go to a finish but he had finished it anyway and before anyone
had to go to work
 for a long time after that everyone had called him the champion and there had been a return
match in the spring but not much money was bet and he had won it quite easily since he had
broken the confidence of the negro from cienfuegos in the first match after that he had a few
matches and then no more he decided that he could beat anyone if he wanted to badly enough and
he decided that it was bad for his right hand for fishing he had tried a few practice matches
with his left hand but his left hand had always been a traitor and would not do what he called on it
to do and he did not trust it
 the sun will bake it out well now he thought it should not cramp on me again unless it gets
too cold in the night i wonder what this night will bring
 an airplane passed overhead on its course to miami and he watched its shadow scaring up the
schools of flying fish
 with so much flying fish there should be dolphin he said and leaned back on the line to see
if it was possible to gain any on his fish but he could not and it stayed at the hardness and water
drop shivering that preceded breaking the boat moved ahead slowly and he watched the airplane
until he could no longer see it
 it must be very strange in an airplane he thought i wonder what the sea looks like from that
height they should be able to see the fish well if they do not fly too high i would like to fly very
slowly at two hundred fathoms high and see the fish from above in the turtle boats i was in the
crosstrees of the masthead and even at that height i saw much the dolphin look greener from
there and you can see their stripes and their purple spots and you can see all of the school as
they swim why is it that all the fastmoving fish of the dark current have purple backs and usually
purple stripes or spots the dolphin looks green of course because he is really golden but when he
comes to feed truly hungry purple stripes show on his sides as on a marlin can it be anger or the
greater speed he makes that brings them out
 just before it was dark as they passed a great island of sargasso weed that heaved and swung in
the light sea as though the ocean were making love with something under a yellow blanket his small
line was taken by a dolphin he saw it first when it jumped in the air true gold in the last of the sun
and bending and flapping wildly in the air it jumped again and again in the acrobatics of its fear and
he worked his way back to the stern and crouching and holding the big line with his right hand and
arm he pulled the dolphin in with his left hand stepping on the gained line each time with his bare
left foot when the fish was at the stem plunging and cutting from side to side in desperation the
old man leaned over the stern and lifted the burnished gold fish with its purple spots over the stem
its jaws were working convulsively in quick bites against the hook and it pounded the bottom of
the skiff with its long flat body its tail and its head until he clubbed it across the shining golden head
until it shivered and was still
 the old man unhooked the fish rebaited the line with another sardine and tossed it over then
he worked his way slowly back to the bow he washed his left hand and wiped it on his trousers
then he shifted the heavy line from his right hand to his left and washed his right hand in the sea
while he watched the sun go into the ocean and the slant of the big cord
 he hasnt changed at all he said but watching the movement of the water against his hand
he noted that it was perceptibly slower
 ill lash the two oars together across the stern and that will slow him in the night he said
hes good for the night and so am i
 it would be better to gut the dolphin a little later to save the blood in the meat he thought i
can do that a little later and lash the oars to make a drag at the same time i had better keep the fish
quiet now and not disturb him too much at sunset the setting of the sun is a difficult time for all
fish he let his hand dry in the air then grasped the line with it and eased himself as much as he
could and allowed himself to be pulled forward against the wood so that the boat took the strain as
much or more than he did
 im learning how to do it he thought this part of it anyway then too remember he hasnt
eaten since he took the bait and he is huge and needs much food i have eaten the whole bonito
tomorrow i will eat the dolphin he called it dorado perhaps i should eat some of it when i clean
it it will be harder to eat than the bonito but then nothing is easy
 how do you feel fish he asked aloud i feel good and my left hand is better and i have
food for a night and a day pull the boat fish
 he did not truly feel good because the pain from the cord across his back had almost passed
pain and gone into a dullness that he mistrusted but i have had worse things than that he thought
my hand is only cut a little and the cramp is gone from the other my legs are all right also now i
have gained on him in the question of sustenance
 it was dark now as it becomes dark quickly after the sun sets in september he lay against the
worn wood of the bow and rested all that he could the first stars were out he did not know
the name of rigel but he saw it and knew soon they would all be out and he would have all his
distant friends
 the fish is my friend too he said aloud i have never seen or heard of such a fish but i
must kill him i am glad we do not have to try to kill the stars
 imagine if each day a man must try to kill the moon he thought the moon runs away but
imagine if a man each day should have to try to kill the sun we were born lucky he thought
 then he was sorry for the great fish that had nothing to eat and his determination to kill him
never relaxed in his sorrow for him how many people will he feed he thought but are they worthy
to eat him no of course not there is no one worthy of eating him from the manner of his
behaviour and his great dignity
 i do not understand these things he thought but it is good that we do not have to try to kill
the sun or the moon or the stars it is enough to live on the sea and kill our true brothers
 now he thought i must think about the drag it has its perils and its merits i may lose so
much line that i will lose him if he makes his effort and the drag made by the oars is in place
and the boat loses all her lightness her lightness prolongs both our suffering but it is my safety
since he has great speed that he has never yet employed no matter what passes i must gut the
dolphin so he does not spoil and eat some of him to be strong
 now i will rest an hour more and feel that he is solid and steady before i move back to the
stern to do the work and make the decision in the meantime i can see how he acts and if he shows
any changes the oars are a good trick but it has reached the time to play for safety he is much fish
still and i saw that the hook was in the corner of his mouth and he has kept his mouth tight shut
the punishment of the hook is nothing the punishment of hunger and that he is against
something that he does not comprehend is everything rest now old man and let him work until
your next duty comes
 he rested for what he believed to be two hours the moon did not rise now until late and he
had no way of judging the time nor was he really resting except comparatively he was still bearing
the pull of the fish across his shoulders but he placed his left hand on the gunwale of the bow
and confided more and more of the resistance to the fish to the skiff itself
 how simple it would be if i could make the line fast he thought but with one small lurch he
could break it i must cushion the pull of the line with my body and at all times be ready to give line
with both hands
 but you have not slept yet old man he said aloud it is half a day and a night and now
another day and you have not slept you must devise a way so that you sleep a little if he is quiet and
steady if you do not sleep you might become unclear in the head
 im clear enough in the head he thought too clear i am as clear as the stars that are my
brothers still i must sleep they sleep and the moon and the sun sleep and even the ocean sleeps
sometimes on certain days when there is no current and a flat calm
 but remember to sleep he thought make yourself do it and devise some simple and sure way
about the lines now go back and prepare the dolphin it is too dangerous to rig the oars as a drag if
you must sleep
 i could go without sleeping he told himself but it would be too dangerous
 he started to work his way back to the stern on his hands and knees being careful not to
jerk against the fish he may be half asleep himself he thought but i do not want him to rest he
must pull until he dies
 back in the stern he turned so that his left hand held the strain of the line across his shoulders
and drew his knife from its sheath with his right hand the stars were bright now and he saw the
dolphin clearly and he pushed the blade of his knife into his head and drew him out from under the
stern he put one of his feet on the fish and slit him quickly from the vent up to the tip of his lower
jaw then he put his knife down and gutted him with his right hand scooping him clean and pulling
the gills clear
 he felt the maw heavy and slippery in his hands and he slit it open there were two flying fish
inside they were fresh and hard and he laid them side by side and dropped the guts and the gills
over the stern they sank leaving a trail of phosphorescence in the water the dolphin was cold and
a leprous graywhite now in the starlight and the old man skinned one side of him while he held his
right foot on the fishs head then he turned him over and skinned the other side and cut each side
off from the head down to the tail
 he slid the carcass overboard and looked to see if there was any swirl in the water but
there was only the light of its slow descent he turned then and placed the two flying fish inside the
two fillets of fish and putting his knife back in its sheath he worked his way slowly back to the bow
his back was bent with the weight of the line across it and he carried the fish in his right hand
 back in the bow he laid the two fillets of fish out on the wood with the flying fish beside them
after that he settled the line across his shoulders in a new place and held it again with his left hand
resting on the gunwale then he leaned over the side and washed the flying fish in the water noting
the speed of the water against his hand his hand was phosphorescent from skinning the fish and he
watched the flow of the water against it the flow was less strong and as he rubbed the side of his
hand against the planking of the skiff particles of phosphorus floated off and drifted slowly astern
 he is tiring or he is resting the old man said now let me get through the eating of this
dolphin and get some rest and a little sleep
 under the stars and with the night colder all the time he ate half of one of the dolphin
fillets and one of the flying fish gutted and with its head cut off
 what an excellent fish dolphin is to eat cooked he said and what a miserable fish raw i
will never go in a boat again without salt or limes
 if i had brains i would have splashed water on the bow all day and drying it would have made
salt he thought but then i did not hook the dolphin until almost sunset still it was a lack of
preparation but i have chewed it all well and i am not nauseated
 the sky was clouding over to the east and one after another the stars he knew were gone it
looked now as though he were moving into a great canyon of clouds and the wind had dropped
 there will be bad weather in three or four days he said but not tonight and not tomorrow
rig now to get some sleep old man while the fish is calm and steady
 he held the line tight in his right hand and then pushed his thigh against his right hand as he
leaned all his weight against the wood of the bow then he passed the line a little lower on his
shoulders and braced his left hand on it
 my right hand can hold it as long as it is braced he thought if it relaxes in sleep my left
hand will wake me as the line goes out it is hard on the right hand but he is used to punishment
even if i sleep twenty minutes or a half an hour it is good he lay forward cramping himself against
the line with all of his body putting all his weight onto his right band and he was asleep
 he did not dream of the lions but instead of a vast school of porpoises that stretched for eight
or ten miles and it was in the time of their mating and they would leap high into the air and return
into the same hole they had made in the water when they leaped
 then he dreamed that he was in the village on his bed and there was a norther and he was very
cold and his right arm was asleep because his head had rested on it instead of a pillow
 after that he began to dream of the long yellow beach and he saw the first of the lions come
down onto it in the early dark and then the other lions came and he rested his chin on the wood of
the bows where the ship lay anchored with the evening offshore breeze and he waited to see if
there would be more lions and he was happy
 the moon had been up for a long time but he slept on and the fish pulled on steadily and
the boat moved into the tunnel of clouds
 he woke with the jerk of his right fist coming up against his face and the line burning out
through his right hand he had no feeling of his left hand but he braked all he could with his right
and the line rushed out finally his left hand found the line and he leaned back against the line and
now it burned his back and his left hand and his left hand was taking all the strain and cutting badly
he looked back at the coils of line and they were feeding smoothly just then the fish jumped
making a great bursting of the ocean and then a heavy fall then he jumped again and again and the
boat was going fast although line was still racing out and the old man was raising the strain to
breaking point and raising it to breaking point again and again he had been pulled down tight onto
the bow and his face was in the cut slice of dolphin and he could not move
 this is what we waited for he thought so now let us take it make him pay for the line he
thought make him pay for it
 he could not see the fishs jumps but only heard the breaking of the ocean and the heavy
splash as he fell the speed of the line was cutting his hands badly but he had always known this
would happen and he tried to keep the cutting across the calloused parts and not let the line slip into
the palm nor cut the fingers
 if the boy was here he would wet the coils of line he thought yes if the boy were here if the
boy were here
 the line went out and out and out but it was slowing now and he was making the fish earn each
inch of it now he got his head up from the wood and out of the slice of fish that his cheek had
crushed then he was on his knees and then he rose slowly to his feet he was ceding line but more
slowly all he time he worked back to where he could feel with his foot the coils of line that he
could not see there was plenty of line still and now the fish had to pull the friction of all that new
line through the water
 yes he thought and now he has jumped more than a dozen times and filled the sacks along
his back with air and he cannot go down deep to die where i cannot bring him up he will start
circling soon and then i must work on him i wonder what started him so suddenly could it have
been hunger that made him desperate or was he frightened by something in the night maybe
he suddenly felt fear but he was such a calm strong fish and he seemed so fearless and so
confident it is strange
 you better be fearless and confident yourself old man he said youre holding him again
but you cannot get line but soon he has to circle
 the old man held him with his left hand and his shoulders now and stooped down and scooped
up water in his right hand to get the crushed dolphin flesh off of his face he was afraid that it might
nauseate him and he would vomit and lose his strength when his face was cleaned he washed his
right hand in the water over the side and then let it stay in the salt water while he watched the first
light come before the sunrise hes headed almost east he thought that means he is tired and going
with the current soon he will have to circle then our true work begins
 after he judged that his right hand had been in the water long enough he took it out and looked
at it
 it is not bad he said and pain does not matter to a man
 he took hold of the line carefully so that it did not fit into any of the fresh line cuts and shifted
his weight so that he could put his left hand into the sea on the other side of the skiff
 you did not do so badly for something worthless he said to his left hand but there was a
moment when i could not find you
 why was i not born with two good hands he thought perhaps it was my fault in not training
that one properly but god knows he has had enough chances to learn he did not do so badly in
the night though and he has only cramped once if he cramps again let the line cut him off
 when he thought that he knew that he was not being clearheaded and he thought he should
chew some more of the dolphin but i cant he told himself it is better to be lightheaded than to
lose your strength from nausea and i know i cannot keep it if i eat it since my face was in it i will
keep it for an emergency until it goes bad but it is too late to try for strength now through
nourishment youre stupid he told himself eat the other flying fish
 it was there cleaned and ready and he picked it up with his left hand and ate it chewing the
bones carefully and eating all of it down to the tail
 it has more nourishment than almost any fish he thought at least the kind of strength that
i need now i have done what i can he thought let him begin to circle and let the fight come
 the sun was rising for the third time since he had put to sea when the fish started to circle
 he could not see by the slant of the line that the fish was circling it was too early for that he
just felt a faint slackening of the pressure of the line and he commenced to pull on it gently with his
right hand it tightened as always but just when he reached the point where it would break line
began to come in he slipped his shoulders and head from under the line and began to pull in line
steadily and gently he used both of his hands in a swinging motion and tried to do the pulling as
much as he could with his body and his legs his old legs and shoulders pivoted with the swinging of
the pulling
 it is a very big circle he said but he is circling then the line would not come in any more
and he held it until he saw the drops jumping from it in the sun then it started out and the old man
knelt down and let it go grudgingly back into the dark water
 he is making the far part of his circle now he said i must hold all i can he thought the
strain will shorten his circle each time perhaps in an hour i will see him now i must convince
him and then i must kill him
 but the fish kept on circling slowly and the old man was wet with sweat and tired deep into his
bones two hours later but the circles were much shorter now and from the way the line slanted he
could tell the fish had risen steadily while he swam
 for an hour the old man had been seeing black spots before his eyes and the sweat salted his
eyes and salted the cut over his eye and on his forehead he was not afraid of the black spots they
were normal at the tension that he was pulling on the line twice though he had felt faint and dizzy
and that had worried him
 i could not fail myself and die on a fish like this he said now that i have him coming so
beautifully god help me endure ill say a hundred our fathers and a hundred hail marys but i
cannot say them now
 consider them said he thought ill say them later just then he felt a sudden banging and
jerking on the line he held with his two hands it was sharp and hardfeeling and heavy
 he is hitting the wire leader with his spear he thought that was bound to come he had
to do that it may make him jump though and i would rather he stayed circling now the jumps
were necessary for him to take air but after that each one can widen the opening of the hook
wound and he can throw the hook
 dont jump fish he said dont jump
 the fish hit the wire several times more and each time he shook his head the old man gave up a
little line
 i must hold his pain where it is he thought mine does not matter i can control mine but his
pain could drive him mad
 after a while the fish stopped beating at the wire and started circling slowly again the old man
was gaining line steadily now but he felt faint again he lifted some sea water with his left hand and
put it on his head then he put more on and rubbed the back of his neck
 i have no cramps he said hell be up soon and i can last you have to last dont even
speak of it
 he kneeled against the bow and for a moment slipped the line over his back again ill rest
now while he goes out on the circle and then stand up and work on him when he comes in he
decided
 it was a great temptation to rest in the bow and let the fish make one circle by himself
without recovering any line but when the strain showed the fish had turned to come toward the
boat the old man rose to his feet and started the pivoting and the weaving pulling that brought in all
the line he gained
 im tireder than i have ever been he thought and now the trade wind is rising but that will be
good to take him in with i need that badly
 ill rest on the next turn as he goes out he said i feel much better then in two or three
turns more i will have him
 his straw hat was far on the back of his head and he sank down into the bow with the pull of
the line as he felt the fish turn
 you work now fish he thought ill take you at the turn
 the sea had risen considerably but it was a fairweather breeze and he had to have it to get
home
 ill just steer south and west he said a man is never lost at sea and it is a long island
 it was on the third turn that he saw the fish first
 he saw him first as a dark shadow that took so long to pass under the boat that he could
not believe its length
 no he said he cant be that big
 but he was that big and at the end of this circle he came to the surface only thirty yards away
and the man saw his tail out of water it was higher than a big scythe blade and a very pale lavender
above the dark blue water it raked back and as the fish swam just below the surface the old man
could see his huge bulk and the purple stripes that banded him his dorsal fin was down and his
huge pectorals were spread wide
 on this circle the old man could see the fishs eye and the two gray sucking fish that swain
around him sometimes they attached themselves to him sometimes they darted off sometimes
they would swim easily in his shadow they were each over three feet long and when they swam fast
they lashed their whole bodies like eels
 the old man was sweating now but from something else besides the sun on each calm placid
turn the fish made he was gaining line and he was sure that in two turns more he would have a
chance to get the harpoon in
 but i must get him close close close he thought i mustnt try for the head i must get the
heart
 be calm and strong old man he said
 on the next circle the fishs beck was out but he was a little too far from the boat on the next
circle he was still too far away but he was higher out of water and the old man was sure that by
gaining some more line he could have him alongside
 he had rigged his harpoon long before and its coil of light rope was in a round basket and the
end was made fast to the bitt in the bow
 the fish was coming in on his circle now calm and beautiful looking and only his great tail
moving the old man pulled on him all that he could to bring him closer for just a moment the fish
turned a little on his side then he straightened himself and began another circle
 i moved him the old man said i moved him then
 he felt faint again now but he held on the great fish all the strain that he could i moved him
he thought maybe this time i can get him over pull hands he thought hold up legs last for me
head last for me you never went this time ill pull him over
 but when he put all of his effort on starting it well out before the fish came alongside and
pulling with all his strength the fish pulled part way over and then righted himself and swam away
 fish the old man said fish you are going to have to die anyway do you have to kill me
too
 that way nothing is accomplished he thought his mouth was too dry to speak but he could
not reach for the water now i must get him alongside this time he thought i am not good for many
more turns yes you are he told himself youre good for ever
 on the next turn he nearly had him but again the fish righted himself and swam slowly away
 you are killing me fish the old man thought but you have a right to never have i seen a
greater or more beautiful or a calmer or more noble thing than you brother come on and kill me
i do not care who kills who
 now you are getting confused in the head he thought you must keep your head clear keep
your head clear and know how to suffer like a man or a fish he thought
 clear up head he said in a voice he could hardly hear clear up
 twice more it was the same on the turns
 i do not know the old man thought he had been on the point of feeling himself go each time
i do not know but i will try it once more
 he tried it once more and he felt himself going when he turned the fish the fish righted
himself and swam off again slowly with the great tail weaving in the air
 ill try it again the old man promised although his hands were mushy now and he could only
see well in flashes
 he tried it again and it was the same so he thought and he felt himself going before he started
i will try it once again
 he took all his pain and what was left of his strength and his long gone pride and he put it
against the fishs agony and the fish came over onto his side and swam gently on his side his bill
almost touching the planking of the skiff and started to pass the boat long deep wide silver and
barred with purple and interminable in the water
 the old man dropped the line and put his foot on it and lifted the harpoon as high as he could
and drove it down with all his strength and more strength he had just summoned into the
fishs side just behind the great chest fin that rose high in the air to the altitude of the mans chest
he felt the iron go in and he leaned on it and drove it further and then pushed all his weight after it
 then the fish came alive with his death in him and rose high out of the water showing all his
great length and width and all his power and his beauty he seemed to hang in the air above the old
man in the skiff then he fell into the water with a crash that sent spray over the old man and over
all of the skiff
 the old man felt faint and sick and he could not see well but he cleared the harpoon line and
let it run slowly through his raw hands and when he could see he saw the fish was on his back with
his silver belly up the shaft of the harpoon was projecting at an angle from the fishs shoulder and
the sea was discolouring with the red of the blood from his heart first it was dark as a shoal in the
blue water that was more than a mile deep then it spread like a cloud the fish was silvery and still
and floated with the waves
 the old man looked carefully in the glimpse of vision that he had then he took two turns of
the harpoon line around the bitt in the bow and hid his head on his hands
 keep my head dear he said against the wood of the bow i am a tired old man but i have
killed this fish which is my brother and now i must do the slave work
 now i must prepare the nooses and the rope to lash him alongside he thought even if we
were two and swamped her to load him and bailed her out this skiff would never hold him i must
prepare everything then bring him in and lash him well and step the mast and set sail for home
 he started to pull the fish in to have him alongside so that he could pass a line through his gills
and out his mouth and make his head fast alongside the bow i want to see him he thought and to
touch and to feel him he is my fortune he thought but that is not why i wish to feel him i think i
felt his heart he thought when i pushed on the harpoon shaft the second time bring him in now
and make him fast and get the noose around his tail and another around his middle to bind him to
the skiff
 get to work old man he said he took a very small drink of the water there is very
much slave work to be done now that the fight is over
 he looked up at the sky and then out to his fish he looked at the sun carefully it is not much
more than noon he thought and the trade wind is rising the lines all mean nothing now the boy
and i will splice them when we are home
 come on fish he said but the fish did not come
 instead he lay there wallowing now in the seas and the old man pulled the skiff upon to him
 when he was even with him and had the fishs head against the bow he could not believe his
size but he untied the harpoon rope from the bitt passed it through the fishs gills and out his jaws
made a turn around his sword then passed the rope through the other gill made another turn
around the bill and knotted the double rope and made it fast to the bitt in the bow he cut the rope
then and went astern to noose the tail the fish had turned silver from his original purple and silver
and the stripes showed the same pale violet colour as his tail they were wider than a mans hand
with his fingers spread and the fishs eye looked as detached as the mirrors in a periscope or as a
saint in a procession
 it was the only way to kill him the old man said he was feeling better since the water
and he knew he would not go away and his head was clear hes over fifteen hundred pounds the
way he is he thought maybe much more if he dresses out twothirds of that at thirty cents a
pound
 i need a pencil for that he said my head is not that clear but i think the great dimaggio
would be proud of me today i had no bone spurs but the hands and the back hurt truly i wonder
what a bone spur is he thought maybe we have them without knowing of it
 he made the fish fast to bow and stern and to the middle thwart he was so big it was like
lashing a much bigger skiff alongside he cut a piece of line and tied the fishs lower jaw against his
bill so his mouth would not open and they would sail as cleanly as possible then he stepped the
mast and with the stick that was his gaff and with his boom rigged the patched sail drew the boat
began to move and half lying in the stern he sailed southwest
 he did not need a compass to tell him where southwest was he only needed the feel of the
trade wind and the drawing of the sail i better put a small line out with a spoon on it and try
and get something to eat and drink for the moisture but he could not find a spoon and his sardines
were rotten so he hooked a patch of yellow gulf weed with the gaff as they passed and shook it so
that the small shrimps that were in it fell onto the planking of the skiff there were more than a
dozen of them and they jumped and kicked like sand fleas the old man pinched their heads off
with his thumb and forefinger and ate them chewing up the shells and the tails they were very tiny
but he knew they were nourishing and they tasted good
 the old man still had two drinks of water in the bottle and he used half of one after he had
eaten the shrimps the skiff was sailing well considering the handicaps and he steered with the tiller
under his arm he could see the fish and he had only to look at his hands and feel his back against
the stern to know that this had truly happened and was not a dream at one time when he was
feeling so badly toward the end he had thought perhaps it was a dream then when he had seen the
fish come out of the water and hang motionless in the sky before he fell he was sure there was some
great strangeness and he could not believe it
 then he could not see well although now he saw as well as ever now he knew there was
the fish and his hands and back were no dream the hands cure quickly he thought i bled them
clean and the salt water will heal them the dark water of the true gulf is the greatest healer that
there is all i must do is keep the head clear the hands have done their work and we sail well with
his mouth shut and his tail straight up and down we sail like brothers then his head started to
become a little unclear and he thought is he bringing me in or am i bringing him in if i were
towing him behind there would be no question nor if the fish were in the skiff with all dignity
gone there would be no question either but they were sailing together lashed side by side and the
old man thought let him bring me in if it pleases him i am only better than him through trickery
and he meant me no harm
 they sailed well and the old man soaked his hands in the salt water and tried to keep his head
clear there were high cumulus clouds and enough cirrus above them so that the old man knew the
breeze would last all night the old man looked at the fish constantly to make sure it was true it
was an hour before the first shark hit him
 the shark was not an accident he had come up from deep down in the water as the dark cloud
of blood had settled and dispersed in the mile deep sea he had come up so fast and absolutely
without caution that he broke the surface of the blue water and was in the sun then he fell back
into the sea and picked up the scent and started swimming on the course the skiff and the fish had
taken
 sometimes he lost the scent but he would pick it up again or have just a trace of it and he
swam fast and hard on the course he was a very big make shark built to swim as fast as the fastest
fish in the sea and everything about him was beautiful except his jaws his back was as blue as a
sword fishs and his belly was silver and his hide was smooth and handsome he was built as a
sword fish except for his huge jaws which were tight shut now as he swam fast just under the
surface with his high dorsal fin knifing through the water without wavering inside the closed double
lip of his jaws all of his eight rows of teeth were slanted inwards they were not the ordinary
pyramidshaped teeth of most sharks they were shaped like a mans fingers when they are
crisped like claws they were nearly as long as the fingers of the old man and they had razorsharp
cutting edges on both sides this was a fish built to feed on all the fishes in the sea that were so fast
and strong and well armed that they had no other enemy now he speeded up as he smelled the
fresher scent and his blue dorsal fin cut the water
 when the old man saw him coming he knew that this was a shark that had no fear at all and
would do exactly what he wished he prepared the harpoon and made the rope fast while he
watched the shark come on the rope was short as it lacked what he had cut away to lash the fish
 the old mans head was clear and good now and he was full of resolution but he had little
hope it was too good to last he thought he took one look at the great fish as he watched the shark
close in it might as well have been a dream he thought i cannot keep him from hitting me but
maybe i can get him dentuso he thought bad luck to your mother
 the shark closed fast astern and when he hit the fish the old man saw his mouth open and his
strange eyes and the clicking chop of the teeth as he drove forward in the meat just above the tail
the sharks head was out of water and his back was coming out and the old man could hear
the noise of skin and flesh ripping on the big fish when he rammed the harpoon down onto the
sharks head at a spot where the line between his eyes intersected with the line that ran straight back
from his nose there were no such lines there was only the heavy sharp blue head and the big eyes
and the clicking thrusting allswallowing jaws but that was the location of the brain and the old
man hit it he hit it with his blood mushed hands driving a good harpoon with all his strength he
hit it without hope but with resolution and complete malignancy
 the shark swung over and the old man saw his eye was not alive and then he swung over once
again wrapping himself in two loops of the rope the old man knew that he was dead but the shark
would not accept it then on his back with his tail lashing and his jaws clicking the shark plowed
over the water as a speedboat does the water was white where his tail beat it and threequarters of
his body was clear above the water when the rope came taut shivered and then snapped the shark
lay quietly for a little while on the surface and the old man watched him then he went down very
slowly
 he took about forty pounds the old man said aloud he took my harpoon too and all
the rope he thought and now my fish bleeds again and there will be others
 he did not like to look at the fish anymore since he had been mutilated when the fish had
been hit it was as though he himself were hit
 but i killed the shark that hit my fish he thought and he was the biggest dentuso that i have
ever seen and god knows that i have seen big ones
 it was too good to last he thought i wish it had been a dream now and that i had never
hooked the fish and was alone in bed on the newspapers
 but man is not made for defeat he said a man can be destroyed but not defeated i am
sorry that i killed the fish though he thought now the bad time is coming and i do not even have
the harpoon the dentuso is cruel and able and strong and intelligent but i was more intelligent
than he was perhaps not he thought perhaps i was only better armed
 dont think old man he said aloud sail on this course and take it when it comes
 but i must think he thought because it is all i have left that and baseball i wonder how the
great dimaggio would have liked the way i hit him in the brain it was no great thing he
thought any man could do it but do you think my hands were as great a handicap as the bone
spurs i cannot know i never had anything wrong with my heel except the time the sting ray stung it
when i stepped on him when swimming and paralyzed the lower leg and made the unbearable pain
 think about something cheerful old man he said every minute now you are closer to
home you sail lighter for the loss of forty pounds
 he knew quite well the pattern of what could happen when he reached the inner part of the
current but there was nothing to be done now
 yes there is he said aloud i can lash my knife to the butt of one of the oars
 so he did that with the tiller under his arm and the sheet of the sail under his foot
 now he said i am still an old man but i am not unarmed
 the breeze was fresh now and he sailed on well he watched only the forward part of the fish
and some of his hope returned
 it is silly not to hope he thought besides i believe it is a sin do not think about sin he
thought there are enough problems now without sin also i have no understanding of it
 i have no understanding of it and i am not sure that i believe in it perhaps it was a sin to kill
the fish i suppose it was even though i did it to keep me alive and feed many people but then
everything is a sin do not think about sin it is much too late for that and there are people who are
paid to do it let them think about it you were born to be a fisherman as the fish was born to be a
fish san pedro was a fisherman as was the father of the great dimaggio
 but he liked to think about all things that he was involved in and since there was nothing to
read and he did not have a radio he thought much and he kept on thinking about sin you did not
kill the fish only to keep alive and to sell for food he thought you killed him for pride and because
you are a fisherman you loved him when he was alive and you loved him after if you love him it is
not a sin to kill him or is it more
 you think too much old man he said aloud
 but you enjoyed killing the dentuso he thought he lives on the live fish as you do he is not a
scavenger nor just a moving appetite as some sharks are he is beautiful and noble and knows
no fear of anything
 i killed him in selfdefense the old man said aloud and i killed him well
 besides he thought everything kills everything else in some way fishing kills me exactly as it
keeps me alive the boy keeps me alive he thought i must not deceive myself too much
 he leaned over the side and pulled loose a piece of the meat of the fish where the shark had cut
him he chewed it and noted its quality and its good taste it was firm and juicy like meat but it was
not red there was no stringiness in it and he knew that it would bring the highest price in the
market but there was no way to keep its scent out of the water and the old man knew that a very
had time was coming
 the breeze was steady it had backed a little further into the northeast and he knew that meant
that it would not fall off the old man looked ahead of him but he could see no sails nor could he
see the hull nor the smoke of any ship there were only the flying fish that went up from his bow
sailing away to either side and the yellow patches of gulf weed he could not even see a bird
 he had sailed for two hours resting in the stern and sometimes chewing a bit of the meat
from the marlin trying to rest and to be strong when he saw the first of the two sharks
 ay he said aloud there is no translation for this word and perhaps it is just a noise such as a
man might make involuntarily feeling the nail go through his hands and into the wood
 galanos he said aloud he had seen the second fin now coming up behind the first and had
identified them as shovelnosed sharks by the brown triangular fin and the sweeping movements of
the tail they had the scent and were excited and in the stupidity of their great hunger they were
losing and finding the scent in their excitement but they were closing all the time
 the old man made the sheet fast and jammed the tiller then he took up the oar with the knife
lashed to it he lifted it as lightly as he could because his hands rebelled at the pain then he opened
and closed them on it lightly to loosen them he closed them firmly so they would take the pain now
and would not flinch and watched the sharks come he could see their wide flattened shovel
pointed heads now and their white tipped wide pectoral fins they were hateful sharks bad
smelling scavengers as well as killers and when they were hungry they would bite at an oar or the
rudder of a boat it was these sharks that would cut the turtles legs and flippers off when the turtles
were asleep on the surface and they would hit a man in the water if they were hungry even if the
man had no smell of fish blood nor of fish slime on him
 ay the old man said galanos come on galanos
 they came but they did not come as the mako had come one turned and went out of sight
under the skiff and the old man could feel the skiff shake as he jerked and pulled on the fish the
other watched the old man with his slitted yellow eyes and then came in fast with his half circle of
jaws wide to hit the fish where he had already been bitten the line showed clearly on the top of his
brown head and back where the brain joined the spinal cord and the old man drove the knife on the
oar into the juncture withdrew it and drove it in again into the sharks yellow catlike eyes the
shark let go of the fish and slid down swallowing what he had taken as he died
 the skiff was still shaking with the destruction the other shark was doing to the fish and the old
man let go the sheet so that the skiff would swing broadside and bring the shark out from
under when he saw the shark he leaned over the side and punched at him he hit only meat and the
hide was set hard and he barely got the knife in the blow hurt not only his hands but his shoulder
too but the shark came up fast with his head out and the old man hit him squarely in the center of
his flattopped head as his nose came out of water and lay against the fish the old man withdrew
the blade and punched the shark exactly in the same spot again he still hung to the fish with his
jaws hooked and the old man stabbed him in his left eye the shark still hung there
 no the old man said and he drove the blade between the vertebrae and the brain it was an
easy shot now and he felt the cartilage sever the old man reversed the oar and put the blade
between the sharks jaws to open them he twisted the blade and as the shark slid loose he said go
on galano slide down a mile deep go see your friend or maybe its your mother
 the old man wiped the blade of his knife and laid down the oar then he found the sheet and
the sail filled and he brought the skiff onto her course
 they must have taken a quarter of him and of the best meat he said aloud i wish it
were a dream and that i had never hooked him im sorry about it fish it makes everything wrong
he stopped and he did not want to look at the fish now drained of blood and awash he looked the
colour of the silver backing of a minor and his stripes still showed
 i shouldnt have gone out so far fish he said neither for you nor for me im sorry fish
 now he said to himself look to the lashing on the knife and see if it has been cut then get
your hand in order because there still is more to come
 i wish i had a stone for the knife the old man said after he had checked the lashing on the
oar butt i should have brought a stone you should have brought many things he thought but
you did not bring them old man now is no time to think of what you do not have think of what
you can do with what there is
 you give me much good counsel he said aloud im tired of it
 he held the tiller under his arm and soaked both his hands in the water as the skiff drove
forward
 god knows how much that last one took he said
 but shes much lighter now he did not want to think of the mutilated underside of the
fish he knew that each of the jerking bumps of the shark had been meat torn away and that the fish
now made a trail for all sharks as wide as a highway through the sea
 he was a fish to keep a man all winter he thought dont think of that just rest and try to get
your hands in shape to defend what is left of him the blood smell from my hands means nothing
now with all that scent in the water besides they do not bleed much there is nothing cut that
means anything the bleeding may keep the left from cramping
 what can i think of now he thought nothing i must think of nothing and wait for the next
ones i wish it had really been a dream he thought but who knows it might have turned out well
 the next shark that came was a single shovelnose he came like a pig to the trough if a pig had
a mouth so wide that you could put your head in it the old man let him hit the fish and then drove
the knife on the oar don into his brain but the shark jerked backwards as he rolled and the knife
blade snapped
 the old man settled himself to steer he did not even watch the big shark sinking slowly in the
water showing first lifesize then small then tiny that always fascinated the old man but he
did not even watch it now
 i have the gaff now he said but it will do no good i have the two oars and the tiller and
the short club
 now they have beaten me he thought i am too old to club sharks to death but i will try it as
long as i have the oars and the short club and the tiller
 he put his hands in the water again to soak them it was getting late in the afternoon and he
saw nothing but the sea and the sky there was more wind in the sky than there had been and soon
he hoped that he would see land
 youre tired old man he said youre tired inside
 the sharks did not hit him again until just before sunset
 the old man saw the brown fins coming along the wide trail the fish must make in the water
they were not even quartering on the scent they were headed straight for the skiff swimming side
by side
 he jammed the tiller made the sheet fast and reached under the stem for the club it was an oar
handle from a broken oar sawed off to about two and a half feet in length he could only use it
effectively with one hand because of the grip of the handle and he took good hold of it with his
right hand flexing his hand on it as he watched the sharks come they were both galanos
 i must let the first one get a good hold and hit him on the point of the nose or straight across
the top of the head he thought
 the two sharks closed together and as he saw the one nearest him open his jaws and sink them
into the silver side of the fish he raised the club high and brought it down heavy and slamming onto
the top of the sharks broad head he felt the rubbery solidity as the club came down but he felt the
rigidity of bone too and he struck the shark once more hard across the point of the nose as he slid
down from the fish
 the other shark had been in and out and now came in again with his jaws wide the old man
could see pieces of the meat of the fish spilling white from the corner of his jaws as he bumped the
fish and closed his jaws he swung at him and hit only the head and the shark looked at him and
wrenched the meat loose the old man swung the club down on him again as he slipped away
to swallow and hit only the heavy solid rubberiness
 come on galano the old man said come in again
 the shark came in a rush and the old man hit him as he shut his jaws he hit him solidly and
from as high up as he could raise the club this time he felt the bone at the base of the brain and he
hit him again in the same place while the shark tore the meat loose sluggishly and slid down from
the fish
 the old man watched for him to come again but neither shark showed then he saw one on the
surface swimming in circles he did not see the fin of the other
 i could not expect to kill them he thought i could have in my time but i have hurt them both
badly and neither one can feel very good if i could have used a bat with two hands i could have
killed the first one surely even now he thought
 he did not want to look at the fish he knew that half of him had been destroyed the sun had
gone down while he had been in the fight with the sharks
 it will be dark soon he said then i should see the glow of havana if i am too far to
the eastward i will see the lights of one of the new beaches
 i cannot be too far out now he thought i hope no one has been too worried there is only the
boy to worry of course but i am sure he would have confidence many of the older fishermen will
worry many others too he thought i live in a good town
 he could not talk to the fish anymore because the fish had been ruined too badly then
something came into his head
 half fish he said fish that you were i am sorry that i went too far out i ruined us both
but we have killed many sharks you and i and ruined many others how many did you ever kill old
fish you do not have that spear on your head for nothing
 he liked to think of the fish and what he could do to a shark if he were swimming free i should
have chopped the bill off to fight them with he thought but there was no hatchet and then there
was no knife
 but if i had and could have lashed it to an oar butt what a weapon then we might have
fought them together what will you do now if they come in the night what can you do
 fight them he said ill fight them until i die
 but in the dark now and no glow showing and no lights and only the wind and the steady
pull of the sail he felt that perhaps he was already dead he put his two hands together and felt the
palms they were not dead and he could bring the pain of life by simply opening and closing them
he leaned his back against the stern and knew he was not dead his shoulders told him
 i have all those prayers i promised if i caught the fish he thought but i am too tired to say
them now i better get the sack and put it over my shoulders
 he lay in the stern and steered and watched for the glow to come in the sky i have half of him
he thought maybe ill have the luck to bring the forward half in i should have some luck no he
said you violated your luck when you went too far outside
 dont be silly he said aloud and keep awake and steer you may have much luck yet
 id like to buy some if theres any place they sell it he said
 what could i buy it with he asked himself could i buy it with a lost harpoon and a broken
knife and two bad hands
 you might he said you tried to buy it with eightyfour days at sea they nearly sold it
to you too
 i must not think nonsense he thought luck is a thing that comes in many forms and who can
recognize her i would take some though in any form and pay what they asked i wish i could see
the glow from the lights he thought i wish too many things but that is the thing i wish for now
he tried to settle more comfortably to steer and from his pain he knew he was not dead
 he saw the reflected glare of the lights of the city at what must have been around ten oclock at
night they were only perceptible at first as the light is in the sky before the moon rises then they
were steady to see across the ocean which was rough now with the increasing breeze he steered
inside of the glow and he thought that now soon he must hit the edge of the stream
 now it is over he thought they will probably hit me again but what can a man do against
them in the dark without a weapon
 he was stiff and sore now and his wounds and all of the strained parts of his body hurt with the
cold of the night i hope i do not have to fight again he thought i hope so much i do not have to
fight again
 but by midnight he fought and this time he knew the fight was useless they came in a
pack and he could only see the lines in the water that their fins made and their phosphorescence as
they threw themselves on the fish he clubbed at heads and heard the jaws chop and the shaking of
the skiff as they took hold below he clubbed desperately at what he could only feel and hear and he
felt something seize the club and it was gone
 he jerked the tiller free from the rudder and beat and chopped with it holding it in both hands
and driving it down again and again but they were up to the bow now and driving in one after the
other and together tearing off the pieces of meat that showed glowing below the sea as they turned
to come once more
 one came finally against the head itself and he knew that it was over he swung the tiller
across the sharks head where the jaws were caught in the heaviness of the fishs head which would
not tear he swung it once and twice and again he heard the tiller break and he lunged at the shark
with the splintered butt he felt it go in and knowing it was sharp he drove it in again the shark let
go and rolled away that was the last shark of the pack that came there was nothing more for
them to eat
 the old man could hardly breathe now and he felt a strange taste in his mouth it was coppery
and sweet and he was afraid of it for a moment but there was not much of it
 he spat into the ocean and said eat that galanos and make a dream youve killed a man
 he knew he was beaten now finally and without remedy and he went back to the stern and
found the jagged end of the tiller would fit in the slot of the rudder well enough for him to steer he
settled the sack around his shoulders and put the skiff on her course he sailed lightly now and he
had no thoughts nor any feelings of any kind he was past everything now and he sailed the skiff to
make his home port as well and as intelligently as he could in the night sharks hit the carcass as
someone might pick up crumbs from the table the old man paid no attention to them and did not
pay any attention to anything except steering he only noticed how lightly and bow well the skiff
sailed now there was no great weight beside her
 shes good he thought she is sound and not harmed in any way except for the tiller that
is easily replaced
 he could feel he was inside the current now and he could see the lights of the beach colonies
along the shore he knew where he was now and it was nothing to get home
 the wind is our friend anyway he thought then he added sometimes and the great sea with
our friends and our enemies and bed he thought bed is my friend just bed he thought bed will
be a great thing it is easy when you are beaten he thought i never knew how easy it was and what
beat you he thought
 nothing he said aloud i went out too far
 when he sailed into the little harbour the lights of the terrace were out and he knew everyone
was in bed the breeze had risen steadily and was blowing strongly now it was quiet in the harbour
though and he sailed up onto the little patch of shingle below the rocks there was no one to help
him so he pulled the boat up as far as he could then he stepped out and made her fast to a rock
 he unstepped the mast and furled the sail and tied it then he shouldered the mast and
started to climb it was then he knew the depth of his tiredness he stopped for a moment and
looked back and saw in the reflection from the street light the great tail of the fish standing up well
behind the skiffs stern he saw the white naked line of his backbone and the dark mass of the head
with the projecting bill and all the nakedness between
 he started to climb again and at the top he fell and lay for some time with the mast across his
shoulder he tried to get up but it was too difficult and he sat there with the mast on his shoulder
and looked at the road a cat passed on the far side going about its business and the old man
watched it then he just watched the road
 finally he put the mast down and stood up he picked the mast up and put it on his shoulder
and started up the road he had to sit down five times before he reached his shack
 inside the shack he leaned the mast against the wall in the dark he found a water bottle and
took a drink then he lay down on the bed he pulled the blanket over his shoulders and then
over his back and legs and he slept face down on the newspapers with his arms out straight and the
palms of his hands up
 he was asleep when the boy looked in the door in the morning it was blowing so hard that the
driftingboats would not be going out and the boy had slept late and then come to the old mans
shack as he had come each morning the boy saw that the old man was breathing and then he saw
the old mans hands and he started to cry he went out very quietly to go to bring some coffee and
all the way down the road he was crying
 many fishermen were around the skiff looking at what was lashed beside it and one was in the
water his trousers rolled up measuring the skeleton with a length of line
 the boy did not go down he had been there before and one of the fishermen was looking
after the skiff for him
 how is he one of the fishermen shouted
 sleeping the boy called he did not care that they saw him crying let no one disturb him
 he was eighteen feet from nose to tail the fisherman who was measuring him called
 i believe it the boy said
 he went into the terrace and asked for a can of coffee
 hot and with plenty of milk and sugar in it
 anything more
 no afterwards i will see what he can eat
 what a fish it was the proprietor said there has never been such a fish those were two
fine fish you took yesterday too
 damn my fish the boy said and he started to cry again
 do you want a drink of any kind the proprietor asked
 no the boy said tell them not to bother santiago ill be back
 tell him how sorry i am
 thanks the boy said
 the boy carried the hot can of coffee up to the old mans shack and sat by him until he woke
once it looked as though he were waking but he had gone back into heavy sleep and the boy had
gone across the road to borrow some wood to heat the coffee
 finally the old man woke
 dont sit up the boy said drink this
 he poured some of the coffee in a glass
 the old man took it and drank it
 they beat me manolin he said they truly beat me
 he didnt beat you not the fish
 no truly it was afterwards
 pedrico is looking after the skiff and the gear what do you want done with the head
 let pedrico chop it up to use in fish traps
 and the spear
 you keep it if you want it
 i want it the boy said now we must make our plans about the other things
 did they search for me
 of course with coast guard and with planes
 the ocean is very big and a skiff is small and hard to see the old man said he noticed how
pleasant it was to have someone to talk to instead of speaking only to himself and to the sea i
missed you he said what did you catch
 one the first day one the second and two the third
 very good
 now we fish together again
 no i am not lucky i am not lucky anymore
 the hell with luck the boy said ill bring the luck with me
 what will your family say
 i do not care i caught two yesterday but we will fish together now for i still have much to
learn
 we must get a good killing lance and always have it on board you can make the blade from a
spring leaf from an old ford we can grind it in guanabacoa it should be sharp and not tempered
so it will break my knife broke
 ill get another knife and have the spring ground
 how many days of heavy brisa have we
 maybe three maybe more
 i will have everything in order the boy said you get your hands well old man
 i know how to care for them in the night i spat something strange and felt something in my
chest was broken
 get that well too the boy said lie down old man and i will bring you your clean shirt
and something to eat
 bring any of the papers of the time that i was gone the old man said
 you must get well fast for there is much that i can learn and you can teach me everything
how much did you suffer
 plenty the old man said
 ill bring the food and the papers the boy said rest well old man i will bring stuff from
the drugstore for your hands
 dont forget to tell pedrico the head is his
 no i will remember
 as the boy went out the door and down the worn coral rock road he was crying again
 that afternoon there was a party of tourists at the terrace and looking down in the water
among the empty beer cans and dead barracudas a woman saw a great long white spine with a huge
tail at the end that lifted and swung with the tide while the east wind blew a heavy steady sea outside
the entrance to the harbour
 whats that she asked a waiter and pointed to the long backbone of the great fish that was
now just garbage waiting to go out with the tide
 tiburon the waiter said shark he was meaning to explain what had happened
 i didnt know sharks had such handsome beautifully formed tails
 i didnt either her male companion said
 up the road in his shack the old man was sleeping again he was still sleeping on his face and
the boy was sitting by him watching him the old man was dreaming about the lions
